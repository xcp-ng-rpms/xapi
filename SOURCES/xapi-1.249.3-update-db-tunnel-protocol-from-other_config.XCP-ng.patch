Fill new `protocol` field in a `Tunnel` record if the info is present in the tunnel's network's other config.

In XCP-ng before 8.2, our open-vxlan-port-for-sdn-controller made XAPI open the vxlan port automatically when
there was a SDN controller, independantly of the protocol (GRE or vxlan).

Starting with XCP-ng 8.2, the new open-vxlan-port-for-sdn-controller patch (based on the PR merged upstream
after stockholm's release [CH 8.2]) adds a new `Tunnel` record with a `protocol` field and only opens the port
if the protocol is vxlan.

In order to still support tunnels created before `Tunnel` was added, the present patch leverages the XAPI database
upgrade mechanism to create the `Tunnel` objects when a tunnel is found, reading the protocol information from
the network's `other_config` field where XO used to put it before the change.

This patch will remain needed as long as we want to support such smooth transition for tunnels created before
XCP-ng 8.2.
